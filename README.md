# Java Strategy Pattern Demo

## Overview
This repository contains a demonstration of the Strategy Design Pattern implemented in Java. The code here is specifically written to accompany a LinkedIn article focusing on the application of design patterns in software development.

## Purpose
The main objective of this repository is to provide a practical example of the Strategy Pattern in Java. It demonstrates key design principles such as "Program to an interface, not an implementation", "Take what varies and encapsulate it", and "Favor composition over inheritance".

## Implementation
The code illustrates the Strategy Pattern through a `DataStorage` example, showcasing how the pattern can be used to dynamically switch between different data storage strategies (like file storage and cloud storage) at runtime.

## Article Link
The detailed explanation and discussion of this implementation can be found in the associated LinkedIn article. 
[Link to the article] (when the article is published, I will insert the link here.)

## Running the Code
The repository contains Java source files that can be compiled and run in any standard Java environment.

## Feedback and Contributions
Feedback and contributions to this repository are welcome. If you have suggestions or want to contribute to the code, please feel free to open an issue or a pull request.
